# # TryHackMe – Pre Security

## Purpose
This document summarizes key security-relevant concepts learned from the TryHackMe Pre Security path, focusing on SOC and defensive relevance.

---

## Key Topics Covered
- Networking Fundamentals
- Web Concepts
- Linux Fundamentals
- Windows Fundamentals
---

## Security-Relevant Takeaways

### Networking
- Common ports and protocols (TCP/UDP)
- Importance of firewalls and proxies
- Essential Networking concepts (LAN,DHCP,Subnetting,OSI Model)

**SOC relevance:** Helps in identifying suspicious traffic and abnormal connections.
---

### Linux Fundamentals
- Linux Overview
- File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)
- Log locations (`/var/log`)
- Process monitoring (`ps`,`TOP`)

**SOC relevance:** Used for detecting unauthorized access or malware activity.
---

### Windows Fundamentals
- Windows Overview
- Security features
- System configuration Utilies (Event viewer, Registry Editor, Resource Monitor,Computer Management)

**SOC relevance:** Critical for endpoint investigation and alert triage.
---

### Web Concepts
-  DNS and related concepts
-  Protocols (HTTP/HTTPS)
-  Basic of HTML,JS
-  Cookies and sessions

**SOC relevance:** Helps in phishing and web-based attack investigations.
---

## Tools Introduced
- Linux command line interface (CLI)
- Windows Utilities (Event viewer, Registry Editor, Resource Monitor,Computer Management)
---

## Practical Skills Gained
- Confident system navigation across Linux and Windows environments  
- Understanding of basic command-line operations and file system structure  
- Ability to identify where logs, configurations, and system artifacts are located  
---

## How This Prepares for SOC Work
Pre Security builds foundational knowledge required to understand alerts, logs, and endpoint behavior in later SOC investigations.

## Next Steps
Proceed to the **Cyber Security 101** path to strengthen core security concepts and begin applying defensive techniques in practical, hands-on scenarios.
